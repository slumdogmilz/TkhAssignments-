                <br>
                To become a fullstack developer in an environment where I can grow

                <b>Skills:</b>
                <br>
                - Excel [<-- fine for now, but as you gain CSS, HTML, and JavaScript experience, you will want to list those skills instead, as they are more relevant]
                <br>
                - 40 WPM typing speed [<-- not really relevant for professional web dev work; you will want to omit in favor of additional skills like Git/GitHub, Bash, VSCode, etc]
                <br>
                - Bilingual [<-- not directly relevant, but impressive and valuable, so good to mention. Also, specify what the other language is]
